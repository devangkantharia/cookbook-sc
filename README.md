# Welsh's Synthesizer Cookbook in SuperCollider

## What is this repo?

This repo contains SuperCollider examples for the figures in Welsh's Synthesizer Cookbook.

It's designed to help learn synthesizer fundamentals at the same time as learning SuperCollider.

Note: You can assume that all accompanying notes (in the comments) are either quotes from the cookbook, or based on information from the cookbook. Any information from other sources is quoted.

## Why did you create this repo?

I wanted a hands-on guide that would give me whirlwind explanation of synthesis at a basic level. I wanted a reference that did this in the context of SuperCollider, but I couldn't find one. So I read the book and wrote the best SuperCollider examples I could think of at the time.

## What is the cookbook?

The first few chapters are a quick, hands-on introduction to synthesis fundamentals. The rest of the book is a catalog of ingredient recipes for using what you have learned to build snythesizers.

## What is SuperCollider?

SuperCollider is a software audio synthesis engine and [domain-specific language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for sound artists, musicians, programmers and academics. You can read more about it [here](http://jahya.net/blog/?2012-05-getting-started-with-supercollider) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider).

## I know all this, can I get started?

Sure, dive in. The code is all sclang ready.

Be sure to get back to me with comments and improvements. Better still, fork the repo and submit pull requests with your contributions!

## I'm new to computer music, what should I do?

When I was new to computer music I was already familiar with programming. That's one reason that SuperCollider was an appealing option for me. It is about code + sound, and so I get all the benefits of being able to program, for example being able to hook up my sounds to ad-hoc [sensors](https://www.adafruit.com/), or other [custom software environments](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) and so on. If you are not familiar with programming, SuperCollider may not be the option for you.

If you are still interested, I left a trail behind me so you can track my steps.

1. To get grounding to what SuperCollider is and if it will work for you, check out my article: [Getting Started with SuperCollider](http://jahya.net/blog/?2012-05-getting-started-with-supercollider)
2. To plough ahead and learn the SuperCollider environment hands-on, read [Read Scott Wilson's tutorial](http://supercollider.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/supercollider/trunk/common/build/Help/Tutorials/Getting-Started/Getting%20Started%20With%20SC.html). This will get you to an understanding of the tools and building blocks at your fingertips.
3. Use my QuickRef to refresh your memory on all the topics and important examples covered in Scott Wilson's tutorial [Quick Reference for SuperCollider](http://jahya.net/blog/?2012-06-quickref-for-supercollider)
3. Get a copy of [the cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Welshs-Synthesizer-Cookbook-Programming-Universal/dp/B000ERHA4S).
4. Use this repo and the patches inside it - and drop me a message to tell how you got on. Better still, fork the repo and submit pull requests with your contributions!
