# Welsh's Synthesizer Cookbook in SuperCollider

## What is this repo?

This repo is designed to help you learn **synthesizer fundamentals** at the same time as learning **SuperCollider**. All the figures from the fundamental chapters of **Welsh's Synthesizer Cookbook** are sketched out as code examples with labels, so you can easily cross-reference.

- Note: Newbies check out the section below:  
**I'm new to computer music, what should I do?**

- Note: All accompanying notes in code comments are based on or inspired by the book, unless otherwise quoted.

## What is SuperCollider?

SuperCollider is a software audio synthesis engine and [domain-specific language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for sound artists, musicians, programmers and academics. It allows you to program (code) sound and music.

## What is Welsh's Synthesizer Cookbook?

The first few chapters are a quick, hands-on introduction to synthesis fundamentals. The rest of the book is a catalog of ingredient recipes for using what you have learned to build snythesizers.

## OK, got it, can I get started?

Sure, dive in. The code is all sclang ready.

## I'm new to computer music, what should I do?

When I was new to computer music I was already familiar with programming. That's one reason that SuperCollider was an appealing option for me. It is about code + sound, and so I get all the benefits of being able to program, for example being able to hook up my sounds to ad-hoc [sensors](https://www.adafruit.com/), or other [custom software environments](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) and so on.

If you are not familiar with programming, SuperCollider may not be the option for you. I would suggest you go and check out some of the many awesome GUI-driven synthesis engines out there.

However, if you are still interested, I left a trail behind me while I learned. Some blog posts and references really helped, others I wrote because I wanted them and they weren't there. This is the route that worked for me:

1. **To get grounding to what SuperCollider is and if it will work for you**, check out my article: [Getting Started with SuperCollider](http://jahya.net/blog/?2012-05-getting-started-with-supercollider)

2. **To plough ahead and learn the SuperCollider environment hands-on**, read [Scott Wilson's tutorial](http://supercollider.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/supercollider/trunk/common/build/Help/Tutorials/Getting-Started/Getting%20Started%20With%20SC.html). This will get you to an understanding of the tools and building blocks at your fingertips.

3. **As you go forward and start making sounds**, use my one-page [Quick Reference for SuperCollider](http://jahya.net/blog/?2012-06-quickref-for-supercollider) to refresh your memory. It gives you concise versions of all the examples you learned from Scott Wilson's tutorial, and saves you having to dig back through to find what you were looking for.

4. Now that you know about the SuperCollider environment and how to create synths, you need a **crash course in audio synthesis**. Get a copy of [the cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Welshs-Synthesizer-Cookbook-Programming-Universal/dp/B000ERHA4S) - the first few chapters are the best crash course I've found. And this repo contains codeblocks which match the figures!

P.S. For ad-hoc help along the way, check out this amazing array of quick tutorial videos by WickieMedia, [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/wickiemedia) or [here](http://www.wickiemedia.net/audio-tutorials.html).

Also, drop me a message to tell how you got on. Better still, fork the repo and submit pull requests with your contributions!

## Why did you create this repo?

I wanted a hands-on guide that would give me whirlwind explanation of synthesis at a basic level. I wanted a reference that did this in the context of SuperCollider, but I couldn't find one. So I read the book and wrote the best SuperCollider examples I could think of at the time.
